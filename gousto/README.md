## Summary

[Gousto](https://www.gousto.co.uk/) built a robust, asynchronous message bus using AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SQS to integrate a microservices platform with ERP and warehouse management systems (WMS), which enabled a near real-time flow of events. We also discuss their roadmap which includes a virtualised simulation of the entire warehouse!
